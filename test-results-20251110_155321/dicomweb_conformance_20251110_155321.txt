HIGH PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. Focus on implementing core DICOMweb operations (QIDO-RS, WADO-RS, STOW-RS)
2. Review DICOMweb specification compliance and implement missing features

CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
----------------------------------------
• Basic Patient Query: Patient query failed with status 404
  Recommendation: Check server configuration and authentication
• Series Metadata Retrieval: Series metadata retrieval failed with status 404
  Recommendation: Check series UID validity and server configuration
• Instance Metadata Retrieval: Instance metadata retrieval failed with status 404
  Recommendation: Check instance UID validity and server configuration
• Content-Type Validation: No Accept headers handled properly
  Recommendation: Implement proper Accept header handling
• Basic DICOM Store: Basic store failed with status 415
  Recommendation: Check STOW-RS implementation and server configuration
• Store with Metadata: Store with metadata failed with status 415
  Recommendation: Check metadata support in STOW-RS implementation
• Store with Authentication: Authenticated store failed with status 415
  Recommendation: Check authentication configuration and permissions

VENDOR-FACING RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
For PACS Vendors and Healthcare IT Teams:

1. CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS
   Address any failed 'Basic' tests immediately as these indicate
   fundamental DICOMweb functionality issues.

2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   If average response times exceed 2 seconds, consider:
   - Database indexing optimization
   - Connection pooling implementation
   - Caching frequently accessed metadata

3. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
   Ensure proper implementation of authentication mechanisms
   for production healthcare environments.

4. ERROR HANDLING
   Implement proper HTTP status codes and error messages
   to facilitate integration and troubleshooting.

5. ONGOING COMPLIANCE
   Run these tests regularly to maintain DICOMweb compliance
   as your system evolves and scales.
